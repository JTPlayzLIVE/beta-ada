title: COVID-19 and the Americans with Disabilities Act

---

“As a Nation, we cannot adequately respond to, and recover from, COVID-19 if we do
not protect all of our neighbors. Civil rights protections and responsibilities still apply, even during emergencies. They cannot be waived.”

Pamela S. Karlan
Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights
Common Questions About COVID and the ADA

{% details Can a business stop me from bringing in my service animal because of the COVID-19 pandemic? %}

No. -
The rules for admitting service animals are the same even during the pandemic.
A service animal is a dog that has been individually trained to do work or perform tasks
for a person with a disability. The tasks must be directly related to the person’s disability.
A business or a state/local government generally must allow a service animal to
accompany a person with a disability into any area where the public is allowed to go. A
service animal cannot be excluded just because staff can provide the same services.
According to the CDC, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to
be low.

EXAMPLE: A restaurant offers indoor and outdoor seating because
of the COVID-19 pandemic. A woman with multiple sclerosis
arrives at the restaurant with her service dog. The restaurant
cannot require the woman to dine outside because of her service
dog.

ADA.gov COVID Page Final (8-18-21)

We do not provide exemptions from mask requirements. We are aware of postings and flyers on
the internet, which include the Department of Justice’s seal. These postings were not issued or
endorsed by us.
Are there resources available that help explain my rights as a disabled
employee during the COVID-19 pandemic?
+
-

Yes.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has information about the ADA and
other federal laws that protect you against employment discrimination during the COVID-19
pandemic.
For more information about your rights, visit the EEOC website at www.eeoc.gov, or call 1-800-
669-4000 (voice), 1-800-669-6820 (TTY), or 1-844-234-5122 (ASL Video Phone). 

Can long COVID be a disability under the ADA?

Yes.

Long COVID can be a disability under the ADA if it substantially limits one or more major life
activities. There is a wide range of ways that this could present itself.
Some examples include:
 A person with long COVID who has lung damage that causes shortness of breath, fatigue,
and related effects is substantially limited in respiratory function, among other major life
activities.
 A person with long COVID who has symptoms of intestinal pain, vomiting, and nausea
that have lingered for months is substantially limited in gastrointestinal function, among
other major life activities.
 A person with long COVID who experiences memory lapses and “brain fog” is
substantially limited in brain function, concentrating, and/or thinking.
Is long COVID always a disability under the ADA?

No.

ADA.gov COVID Page Final (8-18-21)
An individualized analysis is needed to determine whether a person’s long COVID condition
substantially limits the person’s health and daily living.
For more information, see the Department’s Guidance on &quot;Long COVID&quot; as a Disability Under
the ADA, Section 504, and Section 1557.
