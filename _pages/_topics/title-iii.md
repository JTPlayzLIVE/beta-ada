- Religious organizations
- Private clubs (Specific requirements must be met. Charging membership/annual fees does not automatically mean the business is exempt.)

## General Requirement

Businesses must provide people with disabilities an equal opportunity to access the goods or services that they offer.

## Specific Requirements

The ADA also has specific requirements for businesses that are open to the public.

For example, as a business, you must:
- Communicate with people with disabilities as effectively as you communicate with others.
- Make reasonable modifications to policies, practices, and procedures where needed.
- To make sure that a person with a disability can access the businesses’ goods or services.
- Allow service animals to be with their person even if you have a no pets policy.
- Follow specific standards for physical accessibility when building or altering a building or facility.
- Follow specific requirements for ticket sales and testing accommodations.
- Remove architectural barriers in buildings when it is readily achievable to do so.

{% details What are architectural barriers? %}
Architectural barriers are physical elements of a building that prevent movement or access for people with disabilities. For example, a business that is only accessible by stairs creates a barrier for wheelchair users.
{% enddetails %}

{% details What does readily achievable mean? %}
Readily achievable means easy to do without much difficulty or expense. This standard is based on the business’s size and resources. So, a business with more resources is expected to remove more barriers than a business with fewer resources. The ADA strikes a careful balance between increasing access for people with disabilities and understanding the financial challenges of many small businesses.
{% enddetails %}

You can find examples of these requirements and how they look in practice in the tables below.  

You can also learn more about these and other requirements in the ADA Primer for Small Businesses.

## Making Reasonable Modifications

Businesses must make “reasonable modifications” in their policies, practices, and procedures to accommodate a person with a disability. Here are some examples of specific scenarios  involving a person with a disability that could be resolved with a reasonable modification:
