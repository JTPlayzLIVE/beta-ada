## Enforcing the ADA  

Broadly speaking, our ADA matters involve:

- Employment (Title I)
- State and local governmentsâ€™ services, programs, and activities (Title II)
- Businesses and nonprofits open to the public (Title III)  

Our matters are both large and small.  For example, we might work on a discrimination case involving one child in one school or a nationwide case affecting hundreds of people.  

Our matters also cover a range of disability rights issues, such as:  

- Communication with People with Disabilities
- Criminal Justice
- Education
- Employment
- Health Care
- HIV
- Physical Accessibility
- Segregation of people with disabilities (also known as Olmstead work)
- Service Animals
- Technology
- Transportation
- Voting
