In the coming weeks, the Department will be launching a new and improved version of ADA.gov.

## Whatâ€™s different?

The new and improved ADA.gov is:

- Modern with easy to use navigation tools
- User-centered and written in plain-language (less legal jargon)
- Mobile compatible, so it can be used across all devices

## What to expect?

In the coming weeks you can expect to see:

- Content currently on ADA.gov will be moved to archive.ADA.gov
- Content on beta.ADA.gov will be moved to ADA.gov

Our work is not done, we will continue to expand the content available on ADA.gov.
