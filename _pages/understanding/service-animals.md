  The ADA explains what businesses and state and local governments must do to make sure that they do not discriminate against a person with a disability who uses a service animal.

  Generally, businesses and non-profits that are open to the public as well as state and local governments must allow service animals to go most places where the public can go. This is true even if they have a "no pets" policy.

## Service animals are

<ul class="icon-list" aria-labeledby="service-animals-are">
  <li>Dogs.</li>
  <li>Any breed and any size of dog.</li>
  <li>Trained to perform a task related to a person’s disability.</li>
</ul>

## Service animals are not

<ul class="icon-list" aria-labeledby="service-animals-are-not">
  <li>Required to be certified or go through a professional training program.</li>
  <li>Required to wear a vest or other ID that indicates they’re a service dog.</li>
  <li>Emotional support or comfort dogs, because emotional support and comfort dogs are not trained to perform a task related to a person’s disability.</li>
</ul>

## Examples of service animal tasks

A person with diabetes may have a dog that is **trained to nudge the person when their blood sugar reaches high or low levels**.

A person with depression may have a dog that is **trained to perform a task to remind them to take their medication**.

A person with PTSD may have a dog that is **trained to lick their hand to alert them to an oncoming panic attack**.

A person who has epilepsy may have a dog that is **trained to detect the onset of a seizure and then help the person remain safe during the seizure**.

## Where service animals can go

Generally, service animals are allowed to be with their person, even in places that don’t allow pets. For example, service dogs can go into:

- Restaurants
- Shops
- Hospitals
- Schools
- Hotels

### Housing

The ADA applies to certain types of housing, including:

- Public and private universities.
- Public housing programs run by state, county, and city governments.

#### Other laws apply to housing.
You may have additional responsibilities in housing under other laws, such as under the Fair Housing Act.

The **Fair Housing Act** applies to almost all types of housing, both public and privately owned, including housing covered by the ADA. Under the Fair Housing Act, housing may have different laws about service animals. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is responsible for administering the Fair Housing Act. Learn more at the [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/fair_housing_act_overview) or [contact your Regional Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Office](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/contact_fheo).

### Airplanes

#### Other laws apply to airplanes.

The Air Carrier Access Act protects the rights of people with disabilities in air travel. For information or to file a complaint, contact the U.S. Department of Transportation, Aviation Consumer Protection Division: 202-366-2220.

## Asking if a dog is a service animal
If you are working at a business or state or local government facility and it is unclear to you whether someone’s dog is a service dog, **you may ask for certain information using two questions**.

### You may ask:

<ul class="icon-list" aria-labeledby="you-may-ask">
  <li>Is the dog a service animal required because of a disability?</li>
  <li>What work or task has the dog been trained to perform?</li>
</ul>

### You are *not* allowed to:
<ul class="icon-list" aria-labeledby="you-are-not-allowed-to">
  <li>Request any documentation that the dog is registered, licensed, or certified as a service animal.</li>
  <li>Require that the dog demonstrate its task, or inquire about the nature of the person’s disability.</li>
</ul>  

Because service animals are not required to wear vests, a dog that is wearing a vest is not necessarily a service animal. The dog still needs to be trained to perform a task for a person with a disability to be a service animal.

## When a service animal can be kept out

A business or state or local government does not need to allow a service animal if:

- The dog’s presence would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods, services, programs, or activities provided to the public. Learn more about what this means in [FAQs about Service Animals and the ADA](https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html#exc).

## Asking a service animal to leave

A business or state or local government can ask a service animal to leave if:

- The dog is not housebroken.
- The dog is out of control, and the person cannot get the dog under control.

## State and local laws

### Local governments can:
<ul class="icon-list" aria-labeledby="state-and-local-laws">
  <li>Require service dogs to be licensed and vaccinated, if all dogs are required to be licensed and vaccinated.</li>
  <li>Offer <em>voluntary</em> service dog registration programs.</li>
</ul>

### Local governments can't:
<ul class="icon-list" aria-labeledby="state-and-local-laws">
  <li>Require certification or registration of service dogs.</li>
  <li>Ban a service dog based on its breed.</li>
</ul>
