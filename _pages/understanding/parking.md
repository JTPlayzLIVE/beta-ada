  When state or local governments, businesses and nonprofit organizations provide customer or employee parking in parking lots or garages, accessible parking spaces complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) must be provided.

  Accessible parking spaces are different then traditional parking spaces. They have specific features that make it easier for people with disabilities to access your programs, goods or services.

## Features of accessible parking spaces

### Location

In parking lots or garages accessible parking spaces must be located on the shortest accessible route to the accessible entrance. An accessible route is the path a person with a disability takes to enter and move through a building or facility.

### Access aisle

Accessible parking spaces must have access aisles. Access aisles provide a designated area for people who use wheelchairs or other mobility devices to get in and out of their car or van. Mobility devices allow people with disabilities to move about independently. Devices include but are not limited to walkers, canes, crutches, braces, manual or power wheelchairs, Segways and electric scooters.

#### Access aisles must be:

<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-row">
    <div class="tablet:grid-col-6">
      <ul class="icon-list" aria-labeledby="access-aisles-must-be">
        <li>marked (to discourage parking in them)</li>
        <li>the same length as the space it serves</li>
        <li>and level with the parking space it serves</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="tablet:grid-col-6">{% asset project-images/aisle-parking.png alt="A van-accessible parking space sharing an access aisle with an accessible parking space for a car" %}</div>
  </div>
</div>

Two (2) parking spaces can share an access aisle (except in angled parking).

Access aisle can be placed on either side of the parking space (except in angled parking).

### Parking spaces

Accessible parking spaces must be provided for cars and vans.

#### Car accessible spaces must:

<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-row">
    <div class="tablet:grid-col-6">
      <ul class="icon-list" aria-labeledby="car-accessible-spaces-must">
        <li>be at least 96 inches wide</li>
        <li>have an access aisle at least 60 inches wide</li>
        <li>have no more than a 2% slope in all directions</li>
        <li>have a surface that is firm, stable and slip-resistant</li>
        <li>have a sign with the international symbol of accessibility on it, mounted at least 60 inches above the ground (measured to the bottom of the sign)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
      <div class="tablet:grid-col-6">{% asset project-images/car-accessible.png alt="Accessible parking spaces with 60-inch minimum width access aisle for cars" %}</div>
  </div>
</div>

#### Van accessible spaces must:

<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-row">
    <div class="tablet:grid-col-6">
      <ul class="icon-list" aria-labeledby="van-accessible-spaces-must">
        <li>be at least 96 inches wide</li>
        <li>have an access aisle at least 96 inches wide</li>
        <li>have no more than a 2% slope in all directions</li>
        <li>have a surface that is firm, stable and slip-resistant</li>
        <li>have two signs, mounted at least 60 inches above the ground (measured to the bottom of the sign)</li>
        <li>first sign - international symbol of accessibility</li>
        <li>second sign - stating that the space is van accessible</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
      <div class="tablet:grid-col-6">{% asset project-images/van-accessible.png alt="Minimum 96-inch wide van-accessible parking space with 96-inch minimum width access aisle" %}</div>
  </div>
</div>

## Calculating accessible parking spaces

The number of accessible parking spaces must be considered separately for each parking facility, not based on the total number of parking spaces provided on a site.

The chart below shows the number of accessible spaces required by the [2010 Standards](https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/2010ADAStandards/2010ADAstandards.htm%23c2).

<table class="usa-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Total number of parking spaces provided in a parking lot or facility.</th>
      <th scope="col">Minimum number of
accessible parking spaces permitted.</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">1 to 25</th>
