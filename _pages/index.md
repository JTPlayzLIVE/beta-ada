        </h2>
        <div class="crt-landing--separator"></div>
        <p class="crt-landing--description__rights">
          The ADA was signed into law on July 26, 1990, following many years of advocacy by the disability and civil rights communities.
        </p>
        <p class="crt-landing--largetext">
         Since then, the ADA has transformed American society, guaranteeing that people with disabilities have the same opportunities as everyone else to enjoy employment opportunities, purchase goods and services, and participate in state and local government programs.
        </p>
        <p class="crt-landing--largetext">
          The ADA was modeled after the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The ADA is an equal opportunity law for people with disabilities.
