          Since then, the ADA has transformed American society, guaranteeing
          that people with disabilities have the same opportunities as everyone
          else to enjoy employment opportunities, purchase goods and services,
          and participate in state and local government programs.
        </p>
        <p class="crt-landing--largetext">
          The ADA was modeled after the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which
          prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex,
          or national origin. The ADA is an equal opportunity law for people
          with disabilities.
